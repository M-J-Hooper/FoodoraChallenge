# Foodora Challenge

A simple node app that pulls data from resource.
Angular frontend that either lists data in the browser or downloads it as a CSV file.
Added ability to filter list with user input just for fun.

The only prerequisites are Node 8.x and npm 5.x.

To setup, run command "npm install".

To start, run command "npm app.js" and view at http://localhost:8080/.

To run unit tests with Mocha (+Chai), run command "npm test".
